# Welcome to my new vlog!
## Techblog 2.0

I'm very *happy* to announce that **everything is fine now**!

My previous blog was hacked because:
1. I was lazy
2. My password had no numbers and was too small
3. Definitely not 'abc123'!
4. I was using a public coffee network to get stuff done...

Most important of all: now the password is not stored as plain text on the database anymore!

Now, the programmer told me he used this [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) thing 
to make this blog and PHP is bad... well, guess I believe him!
